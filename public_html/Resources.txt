## 1. Paper Shaders Background Implementation

**Library:** `"@paper-design/shaders-react"`

Current implementation setup:

1. **Layering Strategy:** Two `MeshGradient` components stacked
2. **Speed Differential:** Primary (0.3) vs. Wireframe (0.2) to create depth
3. **Color Strategy:** Black anchors + violet/purple accents + strategic white
4. **Opacity Control:** Wireframe at 60% for a subtle overlay effect
5. **Container:** Black fallback background with `overflow: hidden`

This configuration produces excellent visual results. Need similar configurations from other components this library offers.

## 2. Framer Motion Animations

**Implementation Note:** Ask AI: "Can you use motion/react when implementing this"
This will implement the animation using Framer Motion.

## 3. Subtle Quality Animations

### Gooey/Morphing Effects
Two overlapping elements with SVG filters:
• Button groups that merge/separate
• Navigation items that blob together
• Search bars that expand with blob effect

### Magnetic/Attraction Effects
• Magnetic buttons that pull cursor toward them
• Elements that follow mouse movement
• Sticky cursor with trail effects
• Proximity-based animations

### Card Premium Effects
• 3D tilt with depth shadows
• Parallax layered movement on scroll
• Gradient shifts on hover
• Floating/levitation animations
• Glow propagation to nearby elements

### Background Interactions
• Liquid cursor that morphs shape
• Particle systems that react to mouse
• Gradient backgrounds that shift with movement
• Floating geometric shapes
• Mesh distortion effects

### Advanced Micro-interactions
• Self-drawing SVG animations
• Reveal animations with mask effects
• Elastic scaling transitions
• Staggered entrance animations
• Breathing/pulse effects on idle

### Performance Focused
• Smooth 60fps animations
• Hardware acceleration with transform3d
• Debounced mouse tracking
• Intersection observer triggers

## 4. Typography Strategy

Use Google Fonts to get the best fonts, then in many sentences make sure that you change the font of one word - this looks very good.

• [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/)

## 6. Image Addition

Use SVGs as icons and other elements.
