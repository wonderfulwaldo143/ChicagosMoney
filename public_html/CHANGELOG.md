## [2025-09-10]

### Added
- Premium hero treatment with mesh-gradient backdrop, live status badge, and mixed-font typography.
- Magnetic hover/motion-based micro-interactions powered by Motion One for CTAs, presets, stats, and salary rows.
- Gradient-rich card styling for the salary search results, including alternating row backgrounds and elevated shadows.
- New `/budget-dashboard.html` interactive page with live payroll, overtime, and department analytics cards backed by Socrata queries and Chart.js visualizations.
- `/api/snapshot` endpoint to generate branded PNG previews for dashboard stories plus toast feedback for share interactions.

### Changed
- Reset the salary search minimum to start at `0` so users can immediately dial in their own threshold.
