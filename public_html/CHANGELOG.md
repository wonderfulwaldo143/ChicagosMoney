## [Unreleased]

- Homepage hero CTA and promotional card now direct visitors to the salary lookup lab.

### Changed

## [2025-09-10]

### Added
- Premium hero treatment with mesh-gradient backdrop, live status badge, and mixed-font typography.
- Magnetic hover/motion-based micro-interactions powered by Motion One for CTAs, presets, stats, and salary rows.
- Gradient-rich card styling for the salary search results, including alternating row backgrounds and elevated shadows.
- New `/budget-dashboard.html` interactive page with live payroll, overtime, and department analytics cards backed by Socrata queries and Chart.js visualizations.
- `/api/snapshot` endpoint to generate branded PNG previews for dashboard stories plus toast feedback for share interactions.

### Changed
- Reset the salary search minimum to start at `0` so users can immediately dial in their own threshold.
- Reformatted salary table columns with fixed widths and nowrap handling for numeric fields to improve desktop legibility.
- Updated CTA/preset buttons to use new color gradients and glassmorphic accents for consistency with the refreshed hero.
- Bumped service worker cache version to deliver the new styling to returning visitors.
- Replaced the department bar chart with a lightweight insight stack (badges + table) for faster loads.


### Fixed
- Addressed salary table wrapping issues: desktop values now stay on a single line, while mobile cards stack labels/values cleanly without vertical text.
- Ensured mobile salary cards retain the previous readable layout after desktop adjustments by refining the breakpoint flex rules.
