"Tech is too hard" ‚Üí Use ChatGPT to write code, or hire someone on Fiverr for $50

"No time" ‚Üí Start with just ONE product, ONE hour per day

**The Secret:** Every successful business started exactly where you are now. The difference? They started.

**Your unfair advantage:** You're in Chicago. You understand the city. You have access to the data. Nobody else is doing this yet.
